'''This is a prediction. We only have evidence for the values e1 to e6, but we try to estimate the values from 7 to 30 based on the probability of the outcome of the value before. When t increases, the probability will get closer and closer and in the end the same as the stationary state, and in the end converge towards this value.'''
